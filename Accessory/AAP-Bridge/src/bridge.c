/**
 * Remember the difference between "close", "eof" and "cleanup".
 *
 * "close" and "eof" are signals. They can be send from services on one end of the port to the other service on the other remote device.
 *
 * "Eof"  : "I will no longer send bytes and will consider my output to be closed".
 * "Close": "I will no longer expect bytes and will consider my input to be closed"
 *
 * Once both output and input on a port are closed, a cleanup will occur to free all resources and make the port ready for reuse.
 * This situation can occur in the following ways (but not limited to, as all arrows may be reversed and ordered differently):
 *
 * android_service --EOF--> accessory_service
 * android_service --CLOSE--> accessory_service
 * Cleanup now occurs on both sides.
 *
 * android_service --EOF--> accessory_service
 * android_service <--EOF-- accessory_service
 * Cleanup now occurs on both sides.
 *
 * android_service --CLOSE--> accessory_service
 * android_service <--CLOSE-- accessory_service
 * Cleanup now occurs on both sides.
