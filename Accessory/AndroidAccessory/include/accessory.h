/*! \mainpage How to use this library
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This library offers the ability to communicate to a Android device more easily.
 *
 * It does this by offering two ways of communication and abstracting the low-level communication protocol used (bluetooth or usb).
 *
 * \section install_sec Installation
 *
 * This project has the following dependecies:
 * \li libudev for new device detection
 * \li libusb-1.0 for usb communication
 * \li libbluetooth (bluez) for bluetooth communication
 * 
 * All libraries must be installed, regardless if only one form of communication is used.
 *
 * It is a autotools project and detailed instructions for compilation can be read in INSTALL.
 *
 * \subsection step1 Accepting connections from Android devices
 *
 * Briefly: Call `initAccessory()` to start listening. Call `getNextAndroidConnection()` to accept new connection. Now use any of the read/write functions.
 *
 * You may need special permissions to create a bluetooth socket or communicate using usb. This may involve adding yourself to the bluetooth group and writing a udev rule. A alternative is running your program as sudo.
 *
 * \subsection step2 Connecting to the accessory from Android
 * 
 * The Android device initiates the connection and decides if connection should be made using usb or bluetooth.
 *
 * To connect to the accessory using bluetooth you should call [createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice.html#createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord%28java.util.UUID%29) on the bluetooth device associated with the accessory and make sure the uuid is the same as in the `initAccessory()` function.
 * 
 * Read https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/usb/accessory.html if you wish to connect using the usb accessory protocol.
 *

 *
 * This function may be called if no bluetooth device is present or if the bluetooth device can't be accessed. This will result in listening to new usb connections only.
